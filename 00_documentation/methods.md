## Scope of the project
The main aim of this project is to get a hands on overview of analyzing bulk-RNA sequencing data and get familiar with the tools and methods involved in each step of the analysis pipeline. <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Initially, the plan was to create the pipeline from scratch i.e. starting from raw FASTQ files to downstream analysis (Functional Enrichment/GSEA). However, due to hardware limitations some of the steps such as **creating the indexed genome** have been skipped and in place of that pre-indexed genome has been downloaded from the following [webpage](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/hisat).

## Project Progress
- Data Downloaded 
- QC of FASTQ files using FASTQC
- Aggregate QC results using MultiQC
