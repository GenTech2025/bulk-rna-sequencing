## Project Progress

1) Identify and Download Human Bulk-RNA Sequencing Data (Completed)
2) Perform initial Quality Control using FastQC (Completed)
3) Trim the reads if needed (Adapter trimming required in this dataset) (Completed)
4) Download Pre-Built Genome Index and align the reads to the reference genome. (Completed)
5) Quantify the read alignment using featureCounts ad create a gene expression matrix. (Completed)
6) Create metedata file for the gene expression matrix. (Not Completed Yet - 20th December 2025)


## Daily Agenda

#### 20th December 2025

1) Find a way to use the BioSample accessions to retrive information about the sample to map to the run accessions.
2) Extract the run accessions of the samples that showed very poor mapping to the reference genome. (Use the MultiQC report)
