## Summary of the study whose dataset has been used in this project
This study investigated genome-wide gene expression changes in skin from type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients versus non-diabetic controls to understand chronic ulcer mechanisms. RNA sequencing was performed on 27 samples (14 T2D, 13 control) using Illumina HiSeq 4000.

Using DESeq2 analysis, researchers identified 184 differentially expressed genes (64 upregulated, 120 downregulated). Pathway analysis revealed significant disruptions in epigenetic regulation, growth factor signaling, and cell adhesion. These findings pinpoint dysregulated pathways in diabetic skin that may predispose patients to non-healing wounds, highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
